# top_css_landing_page

This has been a difficult, yet exciting challenge!!!!!
My colors,font sizes, and everything else are sort of different from the example site, but it's made from my own fingers.
The moments of actual euphoria can't be explained whenever I solved a certain positioning issue or syntax error spotting.
It took me all day (with a couple breaks here and there) to do this mock-up. This is only 1 of many feats I shall accomplish.
I can't wait.
